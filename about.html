        <h1>About STA Study Hub</h1>
        <p>A student-led project to make test preparation more organized, fair, and accessible.</p>

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            STA Study Hub was created to bring together high-quality notes, mentor tips, and exam-style practice 
            in one place. Instead of every student searching for their own resources, we centralize and organize 
            the best materials available.
        </p>

        <h2>Content Standards</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Resources are contributed by students who have demonstrated strong performance (95%+ where possible).</li>
            <li>All student submissions are reviewed by an administrator before publishing.</li>
            <li>No copyrighted test materials (e.g., current teacher-made tests) are uploaded.</li>
            <li>Resources are meant to support learning, not to replace paying attention in class.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Future Development</h2>
        <p>
            Over time, the goal is to expand the number of supported courses, integrate secure teacher and student 
            logins, and build a fully interactive upload and moderation system.
